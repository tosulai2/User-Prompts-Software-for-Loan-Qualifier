# User-Prompts-Software-for-Loan-Qualifier
UC Fintech Bootcamp Challenge 2
Module 2 Challenge assignment for the UC Berkeley Fintech Bootcamp. 

In this challenge, I applied software-engineering best practices to add new features and enhancements to the loan qualifier application. 

Using the loan qualifier CLI, the tool prompts the user to save the results as a CSV file. 

If no qualifying loans exist, when prompting a user to save a file, then the program should notify the user and exit.

Given a list of qualifying loans, when Iâ€™m prompted to save the results, then I should be able to opt out of saving the file.

Given a list of qualifying loans, when I choose to save the loans, the tool should prompt for a file path to save the file.

Using the loan qualifier CLI, when I choose to save the loans, then the tool should save the results as a CSV file.
